# QuantumScribe Supabase Integration Setup Summary

## Current Status: ✅ Successfully Deployed

The Supabase integration for QuantumScribe has been successfully set up and verified. The following components are now in place:

### Database Schema
- ✅ `projects` table created
- ✅ `epics` table created
- ✅ `stories` table created
- ✅ Indexes for performance optimization
- ✅ Trigger functions for timestamp updates

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ RLS enabled on all tables
- ✅ RLS policies for projects (view, create, update, delete)
- ✅ RLS policies for epics (view, create, update, delete)
- ✅ RLS policies for stories (view, create, update, delete)
- ✅ RLS policies for storage (read, upload, update, delete)

### Storage
- ✅ `project-files` bucket created
- ✅ Storage RLS policies applied

## Verification Results
The verification script has confirmed that:
- ✅ Authentication works correctly
- ✅ Data storage works correctly
- ✅ Data segregation works correctly (users can only access their own data)
- ✅ Storage access works correctly (users can only access their own files)

## Next Steps
1. **User Management**: Test users were created during verification. You may want to delete these test users from the Supabase dashboard.
2. **Application Integration**: Integrate the Supabase client in your QuantumScribe application.
3. **Production Readiness**: Run `npm run check-production` to verify that your setup is ready for production.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the Supabase integration, refer to the `RLS-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` file for troubleshooting tips.

## Maintenance
To make changes to the database schema or RLS policies in the future:
1. Update the SQL files (`create-tables.sql`, `rls-policies-to-execute.sql`, or `complete-setup.sql`)
2. Run the appropriate deployment script or execute the SQL in the Supabase dashboard
