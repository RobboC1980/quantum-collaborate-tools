# Quantum Collaborate Tools

A collaborative application with AI integration using Qwen API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Qwen API key:
   ```
   VITE_QWEN_API_KEY=your-qwen-api-key
   ```

### Starting the Application

#### Option 1: Using the Batch Script (Windows CMD)

```
.\start-app.bat
```

#### Option 2: Using the PowerShell Script (Windows PowerShell)

```
.\start-app.ps1
```

#### Option 3: Using npm directly

```
npm run start
```

This will start both:
- The API proxy server on port 3001
- The Vite development server on port 3000

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter port conflicts, the startup scripts will attempt to terminate processes using the required ports (3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004).

If you still encounter issues:
1. Manually check for processes using the required ports:
   ```
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   netstat -ano | findstr :3001
   ```

2. Terminate the processes manually:
   ```
   taskkill /F /PID <process_id>
   ```

## Features

- React frontend with Shadcn UI components
- Integration with Qwen AI API
- API proxy server for secure communication

# QuantumScribe - Project Management Application

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation

The application implements a complete role-based access control system that seamlessly integrates with Supabase for authentication and database access.

### Backend Components

1. **Database Tables**
   - `roles`: Stores role definitions with name, description, and system/default flags
   - `permissions`: Stores available permissions with category and action
   - `role_permissions`: Junction table connecting roles to their permissions
   - `user_roles`: Junction table assigning roles to users

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `roles-api`: Supabase Edge Function that handles role management operations
     - GET /roles - List all roles with their permissions
     - GET /roles/:id - Get a specific role by ID
     - POST /roles - Create a new role
     - PUT /roles/:id - Update an existing role
     - DELETE /roles/:id - Delete a role
     - GET /permissions - List all available permissions
     - POST /user-roles - Assign a role to a user
     - DELETE /user-roles - Remove a role from a user
     - GET /user-roles - Get roles assigned to a user

3. **Authorization Middleware**
   - `auth-middleware`: Supabase Edge Function that verifies user permissions
     - Validates user JWT tokens
     - Checks if users have required permissions
     - Supports wildcard permissions and category:action format

### Frontend Components

1. **Service Layer**
   - `roleService.ts`: API client for interacting with the role management endpoints
     - Handles authentication token management
     - Transforms data between API and UI formats
     - Provides error handling and status messaging

2. **React Hooks**
   - `useRoles`: Custom hook for role management functionality
     - Fetches and caches roles and permissions
     - Provides methods for CRUD operations on roles
     - Handles state management and UI feedback
   - `useAuth`: Extended to include permission checking functionality
     - Manages authentication state
     - Provides `hasPermission` method to check user permissions

3. **UI Components**
   - `RolesManagement`: Main component for managing roles and permissions
   - `RolesList`: Displays available roles in the system
   - `RoleDetails`: Shows detailed information about a specific role
   - `RoleForm`: Form for creating and editing roles
   - `UserRoleAssignment`: Interface for assigning roles to users
   - `PermissionGuard`: Component for conditionally rendering UI based on permissions
   - `AnyPermissionGuard`: Component for checking multiple permissions

### Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Database tables are protected with RLS policies
   - Users can only access data they are authorized to see

2. **JWT Validation**
   - All API requests validate JWT tokens
   - Permissions are checked against the user's assigned roles

3. **Fine-Grained Permissions**
   - Permissions follow the format `category:action`
   - Support for wildcard permissions (e.g., `projects:*`)
   - Hierarchical permission structure

## Usage Examples

### Protecting UI Elements

```tsx
<PermissionGuard permission="roles:manage">
  <Button>Manage Roles</Button>
</PermissionGuard>
```

### Checking Permissions in Code

```tsx
const { hasPermission } = useAuth();
const canEditProject = await hasPermission('projects:edit');
```

### Assigning Roles

```tsx
const { assignRoleToUser } = useRoles();
await assignRoleToUser({ userId: 'user-id', roleId: 'role-id' });
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Role inheritance for more complex permission hierarchies
2. Time-limited role assignments
3. Audit logging for permission changes
4. Dynamic permission generation based on system features

# QuantumScribe Supabase Integration Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools and documentation to help you set up, verify, and deploy your Supabase integration for QuantumScribe in a production environment.

## üìö Documentation

- [**SUPABASE-PRODUCTION-GUIDE.md**](./SUPABASE-PRODUCTION-GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive guide for setting up Supabase for production
- [**SUPABASE-VERIFICATION.md**](./SUPABASE-VERIFICATION.md) - Instructions for verifying your Supabase integration
- [**SUPABASE-SETUP.md**](./SUPABASE-SETUP.md) - Initial setup guide for Supabase

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

This repository includes several tools to help you verify and deploy your Supabase integration:

### Verification Script

The `supabase-verification.js` script tests your Supabase integration by:
- Testing user authentication
- Testing data storage for projects, epics, and stories
- Testing data segregation between users
- Testing storage functionality and access control

```bash
npm run verify
```

### Production Readiness Check

The `check-production-readiness.js` script checks if your Supabase configuration is ready for production by verifying:
- Environment variables
- Database schema
- RLS policies
- Storage configuration
- Authentication settings
- Database indexes

```bash
npm run check-production
```

### RLS Policy Deployment

The `deploy-rls-policies.js` script helps you deploy Row Level Security (RLS) policies to your Supabase project:

```bash
npm run deploy-rls
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantumscribe-supabase-tools.git
   cd quantumscribe-supabase-tools
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your Supabase credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run the verification script:**
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

5. **Check production readiness:**
   ```bash
   npm run check-production
   ```

## üìã Files Included

- `supabase-verification.js` - Script to verify Supabase integration
- `check-production-readiness.js` - Script to check production readiness
- `deploy-rls-policies.js` - Script to deploy RLS policies
- `supabase/migrations/20240301_rls_policies.sql` - SQL file with RLS policies
- `.env.example` - Example environment variables file
- `package.json` - Node.js package configuration

## üîí Security Considerations

- Never commit your `.env` file with real credentials
- Keep your service role key secure and never expose it in client-side code
- Regularly review your RLS policies to ensure proper data segregation
- Monitor your Supabase project for unusual activity
